      I am currently working on two research projects. The first belongs to my
      Masters thesis project, in which Dr. Covantes is my main advisor and Dr.
      Lopez-Mago is my co-advisor. The second project came out from a final
      assignment of a course, which my teammate Mauricio Mendez and myself are
      now transforming into a research paper with the help from Dr. Bayliss. I
      now provide a brief description of both works.

    <h2>Jones Matrix Characterization via Evolutionary Strategies</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <p>
        Jones calculus provides a robust and straightforward method to
        characterize polarized light and polarizing optical systems using
        two-element vectors (Jones vectors) and 2 x 2 matrices (Jones matrices),
        respectively. Jones matrices are used to determine the retardance and
        diattenuation introduced by an optical element or a sequence of
        elements. Moreover, they are the tool of choice to study optical
        geometric phases. However, the current sampling method for
        characterizing the Jones matrix of an optical element is inefficient,
        since the characterization of any given element is time-consuming. In
        this study, we present an initial approach for solving the problem of
        finding the eigenvectors that characterize the Jones matrix of a
        homogeneous optical element through Evolutionary Strategies (ES). We
        restrict our study to matrices with mutually orthogonal eigenvectors,
        which in the context of polarized light, are named homogeneous Jones
        matrices. We evaluate the analytical performance of an Evolutionary
        Algorithm (EA) with a Polynomial Mutation operator and a Genetic
        Algorithm (GA) with a Simulated Binary crossover operator and a
        Polynomial Mutation operator, and compare the results with those
        obtained through the traditional sampling method. The analytical results
        show that both the EA and the GA out-performed the traditional sampling
        method of 720 measurements, by requiring in average 103 and 179 fitness
        functions measurements respectively, while having a perfect rate of
        convergence.

    <h2>A Multi-Verse Hyper Heuristic for Solving the Knapsack Problem</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <p>
        Heuristics have proved to be a reliable technique for solving
        challenging combinatorial optimization problems These heuristics are
        customized for each particular problem domain and achieve good-quality
        solutions under various scenarios. However, no single heuristic performs
        the best on every instance of the problem. This fact opens the door for
        methods such as the hyper-heuristics that combine the strengths of
        single heuristics to build-up more competent solvers. In this work, we
        present a novel hyper-heuristic model based on the multi-verse optimizer
        for solving the knapsack problem. We tested the hyper-heuristic model on
        a set of knapsack instances from different sources and compared its
        performance against single heuristics and an evolutionary-based
        hyper-heuristic approach taken from the literature. We obtained
        promising results where the proposed approach outperformed both the
        single heuristics and the evolutionary-based hyper-heuristic model.
        These results support the idea that the multi-verse optimizer represents
        a reliable strategy to produce hyper-heuristics for solving the knapsack
        problem.

          <b>Figure 2.</b> Heuristic selection at three different stages of the
          KP. Initially, the problem features maps to KP<sub>1</sub> and falls
          closest to H<sub>1</sub>, so H<sub>1</sub> is used to select an item
          for the knapsack. Then, with one less item to pick from, the KP maps
          to KP<sub>2</sub> and still falls closest to H<sub>1</sub>, so H<sub
            >1</sub
          >
          is used to pick the next item. Finally, the KP maps to KP<sub>3</sub>
          and now H<sub>2</sub> is the closest heuristic and, therefore, H<sub
            >3</sub
          >
          is used to pick the last item.
