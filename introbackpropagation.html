    <h1>A Gentle Introduction to the Mathematics of Back-Propagation</h1>

    <p class="date">December 9, 2022</p>

    <p>
      We train neural networks to perform well at specific tasks by defining a
      loss function. The loss function outputs a numeric score that describes
      how good or bad the network is performing at a specific task. Commonly,
      the loss function is denoted as $\mathcal{L}(y,\hat{y})$, where $\hat{y}$
      is the output of the network given an observation $x$ and it's true label
      $y$. Using an evaluation of the loss function we can improve the
      predictions of a feed-forward neural network using the back-propagation
      algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      Usually, the back-propagation algorithm is explained for the simpler case
      of the output layer and the last hidden layer and the reader is left to
      understand how this logic propagates to the inner layers of the network.
      Therefore, the aim of this post is to explain the back-propagation
      algorithm in an accessible way, where you, the reader, will understand the
      complete logic and math behind the algorithm. This post will be divided
      into three main sections:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Derivatives</strong> → In this first section, we will make a
        quick recap on derivatives, since the way by which we can take advantage
        of the evaluation of the loss function $\mathcal{L}(y,\hat{y})$, to
        improve the predictions of a network has to do with derivatives.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A Neural's Network Structure</strong> → After we recap on how
        derivatives are useful, we will set the mathematical foundations for how
        we can define a simple neural network. The mathematical notation
        introduced in this second section will be helpful to generalize the
        notation in what follows.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Back-Propagation Algorithm</strong> → Finally, we will be
        ready to introduce the back-propagation algorithm.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Let's get started.</p>
    <h2>Derivatives</h2>
    <p>
      Recalling a bit of calculus, the derivative of a function $f(x)$ tells us
      how rapidly the function is changing, a property that can help us find the
      minimizer $x^*$ of $f(x)$. The minimizer is defined such that $f(x^*)$ is
      smaller than $f(x)$ for any value of $x$ different from $x^*$. In other
      words, $f(x^*) f(x) \forall x \neq x^*$.
    </p>

    <p>
      To clarify what a minimizer is, let's follow the example from
      <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/inside-deep-learning"
        >Edward Raff</a
      >
      and minimize the function $f(x) = (x - 2)^2$, shown below in Figure 1.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/basicsofneuralnetworks/x-22.png"
        style="width: 27vw"
        alt="Function plot"
      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 1.</strong> $f(x) = (x-2)^2$</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Calculating the derivative we get $\mathrm{d}f/\mathrm{d}x=2x-4$. The
      minimizer of a function exists at critical points, which are points where
      $\mathrm{d}f/\mathrm{d}x$ evaluates to $0$. In this case, we get $2x-4=0$,
      meaning the minimizer $x^*$ is equal to $2$. We can clearly confirm this
      visually in Figure 2.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/basicsofneuralnetworks/x-4.png"
        style="width: 27vw"
        alt="Function with derivative plot"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 2.</strong> $f(x) = (x-2)^2$ and $f'(x) = x-4$
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      So finding the minimizer $x^*$required us to compute the derivative of
      $f(x)$ and solve for $\mathrm{d}f(x)/\mathrm{d}x = 0.$ Though, with more
      complicated functions it is not as easy to solve for the minimizer.
      Nonetheless, we can take a similar approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's assume we can't solve for $\mathrm{d}f(x)/\mathrm{d}x = 0$ but that
      we have an initial guess $x^?$ . We can evaluate
      $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x$ and determine how to adjust $x^?$ based on
      the result and move closer to the minimizer. Returning to our previous
      example, looking at $f(x)$ and $\mathrm{d}f(x)/\mathrm{d}x$, we can see
      that when we are to the left of the minimizer
      $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x < 0$ and when we are to the right of the
      minimizer $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x > 0$. Only when we are exactly at
      the minimum we get $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x=0$. So if after
      evaluating our initial guess $x^?$ we get $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x <
      0$, we need to increase the value of $x^?$, and if we get
      $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x>0$, we need to decrease $x^?$. Thus we get
      three simple rules:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>$\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x < 0$ → We increase $x^?$</li>
      <li>$\mathrm{d}f(x)/\mathrm{d}x > 0$ → We decrease $x^?$</li>
      <li>$\mathrm{d}f(x)/\mathrm{d}x = 0$ → We found the minimizer $x^*$</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In other words, the sign of the derivative tells us towards which
      direction we need to move to find the minimizer. Plus, the magnitude of
      the gradient gives us an idea of how far we are from the minimizer. And
      since we update $x^?$ in the opposite direction of
      $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x$, we can update $x^?$ with respect to the
      negative of $\mathrm{d}f(x^?)/\mathrm{d}x$, $$ x^? = x^? -
      \frac{\mathrm{d}f(x^?)}{\mathrm{d}x}.$$
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, we can iteratively evaluate and update the value of xᵍ towards
      a closer value to $x^?$.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example we worked with a uni-variable function, though with neural
      networks we work with multi-variable functions. So let's work with a
      simple multi-variable function next. Given the function $f(x, y) = x\, y$,
      we can calculate the partial derivative with respect to a single variable
      taking the other variables as constants,
      $$\frac{\partial{f(x,y)}}{\partial{x}} = y \quad \text{and} \quad
      \frac{\partial{f(x,y)}}{\partial{y}} = x.$$
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking the partial derivative with respect to each variable is known as
      the gradient of a function, $$ \nabla f(x,y) = \left(
      \frac{\partial{f(x,y)}}{\partial{x}}, \frac{\partial{f(x,y)}}{\partial{y}}
      \right), $$ meaning the gradient points towards the direction of greatest
      ascent of $f(x,y)$. In our example, we get $ \nabla f(x,y) = \left( y, x
      \right).$ Also, note that the gradient can also be calculated for
      univariate functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      As before, we can use the partial derivatives with respect to each
      variable (i.e. the gradient) to move towards the minimizer with respect to
      every variable. So, as before, we update our guess $\left(x^?,y^?\right)$
      with respect to the negative of the gradient, $$ \left(x^?,y^?\right) =
      \left(x^?,y^?\right) - \nabla f(x,y)$$
    </p>

    <p>
      Updating our guess $\left(x^?,y^?\right)$ and evaluating it repeatedly
      until we find the minimizer or a good enough solution, gives us what is
      known as gradient descent.
    </p>

    <h2>A Neural Network's Structure</h2>

    <p>
      Let's continue by reviewing the basic structure of a neural network by
      building a simple feedforward neural network. As seen below in Figure 3,
      our neural network takes as input a vector $\bm{x} = (x_0, x_1) \subset
      \mathcal{R}^2 $, i.e. $x$ is a two-dimensional vector of real numbers. For
      example we could have as input the values $\bm{x} = (87, 10)$. Generally
      we refer to $\bm{x}$ as the input layer. Each element in the input layer
      is fed to all neurons in the first hidden layer, composed of the set of
      neurons $\bm{h}^{[1]} = \left\{\bm{n}_0^{[1]}, \bm{n}_1^{[1]}\right\}$,
      where the under-scripts refer to a specific neuron and the super-scripts
      denote the layer. At the end we have the output layer $\hat{y}$, which
      outputs the prediction of our network.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/basicsofneuralnetworks/basic_nn.png"
        style="width: 550px"
        alt="Basic feed-forward neural network"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <b>Figure 3.</b> Simple feedforward neural network.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Neurons in all layers have forward weighted connections, meaning each
      connection has an associated weight $w_{i,j}^{[l]}\, .$ Following our
      simple network in Figure 3, both neurons in the input layer are connected
      to the second neuron in the first hidden layer by the following set of
      input weighted connections $\left\{w^{[1]}_{0,1},w^{[1]}_{1,1}\right\} \in
      \bm{n}_1^{[l]}.$ As you can now probably infer, the super-script in each
      weight references the layer of the incoming connection and the
      under-script refers to the neurons being connected, with the order
      indicating the direction of the connection. Also, since this network is
      composed only of forward weighted connections, we have what is known as a
      feed-forward neural network.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each neuron is composed of a pre-activation $z$ and a non-linear
      activation $a$, see Figure 4.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/basicsofneuralnetworks/basic_nn_functions.png"
        style="width: 550px"
      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 4.</strong> Each neuron in the hidden layer is composed
        of a pre-activation $z$ and an activation $a$. In this case, the output
        layer is only composed of the pre-activation.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The pre-activation $z_i^{[l]}$ is the sum of the incoming weighted
      connections of a neuron. For example, for the same second neuron in the
      first hidden layer $n_1^{[1]}$ we have $$ z_1^{[1]} = x_0 \cdot
      w_{0,1}^{[1]} +x_1 \cdot w_{1,1}^{[1]} + b_1^{[1]} , $$ where the term
      $b_1^{[1]}$ is a constant known as the bias, which defines the intercept
      of $z_1^{[1]}$. Then, the activation $a_1^{[1]}$ is a non-linear
      activation of the pre-activation $z_1^{[1]}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pre-activation $z_i^{[l]}$ is followed by a non-linear activation
      function that outputs the activation $a_i^{[l]}.$ For our neuron
      $n_1^{[1]}$, we have $$ a_1^{[1]} = g\left(z^{[1]}_1\right), $$ where
      $g(\cdot)$ is a non-linear function. The activation must be non-linear in
      order to create a complex network. Otherwise, the network collapses to a
      linear function, as we we would be simply performing multiplications with
      constants over our input and summations of the results. For example,
      imagine the neurons in our network are just composed of pre-activations
      $z_i^{[l]}$ without the activations $a_i^{[l]}$. Then, we could write down
      are network as $$ \begin{aligned} \hat{y} &= w_{0,0}^{[2]}
      \left(w_{0,0}^{[1]} \cdot x_0 + w_{1,0}^{[0]} \cdot x_1\right) +
      w_{1,0}^{[2]}\left(w_{0,1}^{[1]} \cdot x_0 + w_{1,1}^{[0]} \cdot
      x_1\right),\\ &= \left( w_{0,0}^{[2]}\cdot w_{0,0}^{[1]} +
      w_{1,0}^{[2]}\cdot w_{0,1}^{[1]} \right) \cdot x_0 + \left(
      w_{0,0}^{[2]}\cdot w_{1,0}^{[1]} + w_{1,0}^{[2]}\cdot w_{1,1}^{[1]}
      \right) \cdot x_1,\\ &= a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot x_1, \end{aligned} $$ where
      both $a$ and $b$ are constants. Meaning that adding the non-linear
      activation functions $g$ prevents the network from collapsing to a linear
      function and creates a more complex function, $$ \hat{y} = w_{0,0}^{[2]}
      \left( g\left(w_{0,0}^{[1]} \cdot x_0\ + w_{1,0}^{[0]} \cdot
      x_1\right)\right) + w_{1,0}^{[2]}\left( g\left(w_{0,1}^{[1]} \cdot x_0 +
      w_{1,1}^{[0]} \cdot x_1\right)\right), $$ where the non-linear activation
      functions prevent the network from simplifying to a linear function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving forward, let's define the non-linear function
      $g\left(z_i^{[l]}\right).$ To simplify our explanation, we will define $g$
      as the sigmoid activation function, $$ g\left(z_i^{[l]}\right) =
      \frac{1}{1+ e^{-\gamma z_i^{[l]}}} \, , $$ and, again for simplicity, we
      set $\gamma=1$. The sigmoid activation function has an S-shaped curve with
      a domain in the real numbers and a range between 0 and 1, as seen in the
      image Figure 5.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/basicsofneuralnetworks/sigmoid_activation.png"

      />
      <figcaption>
        <strong>Figure 5.</strong> The sigmoid activation function.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In our bak-propagation algorithm we will need to compute the derivative of
      $g$. So let's calculate it now and prevent from over complicating our
      explanation later on. Taking the derivative of $g$ with resect to $z$, we
      find $$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \frac{\mathbb{d}
      g(z)}{\mathbb{d}z} &= \frac{0 \cdot (1+e^{-z}) -
      1\cdot(-e^{-z})}{(1+e^{-z})^2},\\ &= \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\left(
      \frac{e^{-z}}{1+e^{-z}} \right),\\ &= \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}\left( 1 -
      \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} \right),\\ &= g(z)(1-g(z)). \end{aligned}
      \end{equation} $$ Remember, we will come back to this result later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The activation function of the output layer $\hat{y}$ depends on the task
      at hand. When the output layer does not have an activation function,
      $\hat{y}$ simply corresponds to the pre-activation $z$. Since the sigmoid
      activation function function evaluates to a real number between 0 and 1,
      multiplying the activations of the last hidden layer by the set of weights
      $\left\{w_{0,0}^{[2]}, \, w_{1,0}^{[2]}\right\}$ of the output layer and
      adding the results gives a real number. In other words, the prediction
      $\hat{y}$ is an element of the set of real numbers $\hat{y} \in
      \mathcal{R}$. Meaning that a network with no activation in the output
      layer will be useful for a regression task. As some writers like to say,
      the attentive reader will have seen that our network has no activation
      function in the output layer, so we have defined a network useful for a
      regression task. On the contrary, when we do have an activation function,
      we restrict the values of the output layer to the range of the selected
      activation function $g$, creating a network useful for classification
      tasks. As a side note, to keep things simple, we defined an output layer
      composed of a single neuron, but a network can have multiple neurons in
      the output layer if the task at hand requires so.
    </p>

    <p>And that's it, we have defined a simple feed-forward neural network.</p>

    <h2>Evaluating A Neural Network</h2>
    <p>
      Now let's proceed to the main goal of this post. As stated in the
      introduction, we define a loss function $\mathcal{L}(y, \hat{y})$ to see
      how good or bad our network is. Intuitively, the loss is the difference
      between the expected output $y$ and the output of the network $\hat{y}$.
    </p>

    <p>
      A popular loss function is the squared error, defined as $$ \mathcal{L}(y,
      \hat{y}) = \frac{1}{2} \left( y_i - \hat{y} \right) ^2,$$ where the factor
      of $1/2$ is added for convenience when calculating the derivative. Observe
      that the loss can only be calculated for the output layer.
    </p>

    <h2>Back-Propagation Algorithm</h2>

    <h3>Generalizing A Neural Network</h3>

    <p>
      Now that we reviewed the general structure of a simple neural network and
      got familiar with the notation, we generalize to a feed-forward neural
      network of $L$ layers, each composed of $k$ neurons. In Figure 6, we
      depict a pair of neurons $n_k^{[l-1]}$ and $n_j^{[l]}$ of this generalized
      network, where we use the under-scripts $k$ and $j$ to refer to any neuron
      from layers $l-1$ and $l$ respectively.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/basicsofneuralnetworks/general_nn.png"
        style="width: 750px"
      />
      <figcaption><b>Figure 6.</b></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      For neuron $n_j^{[l]}$, we have a pre-activation $$ z_j^{[l]} = b_j^{[l]}
      + \sum_{k=0}^{\left|\bm{h}^{l}\right|} w_{k,j}^{[l]} \cdot a_k^{[l-1]} ,
      $$ where again the summation is over the activations from the set of
      neurons in the previous hidden layer that feed neuron $n_j^{[l]}$. This
      means that the pre-activation of $n_j^{[l]}$ depends on the activations
      $a_k^{[l-1]}$ of all neurons in the last layer. In the Figure 6, we depict
      the rest of the neurons in layer $l-1$ as the ellipsis points of the other
      pair of incoming connections to neuron $n_j^{[l]}.$
    </p>
    <p>
      The activation $a_k^{[l-1]}$ of a neuron $n_j^{[l]}$ in the previous layer
      is defined as $$ a_k^{[l-1]} = g\left(z^{[l-1]}_k\right), $$ where
      $g(\cdot)$ is the sigmoid activation function we defined earlier.
    </p>

    <h3>Back-Propagation</h3>

    <p>
      Remembering that the gradient helps us identify the global minimum of a
      function, we can calculate the gradient of the loss $\mathcal{L}$ with
      respect to any weight to improve the predictions of our network, $$ w
      _{k,j}^{[l]} = w _{k,j}^{[l]} - \nabla_{k,j}^{[l]}\mathcal{L}, $$ where
      the gradient operator $\nabla$ specifies with respect to which neuron we
      are calculating the derivative and the parameter $\alpha$, known as the
      learning rate, scales the magnitude of the change so that we can control
      the rate of our update. In other words, this means that we can calculate
      the gradient of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to any weight in our network to
      improve the error.
    </p>

    <p>
      As we will see next, each weight impacts the prediction of the network
      differently. For example, the error of a weight in the first hidden layer
      propagates over all other neurons it is connected to until, from the next
      neurons in the next layer until the prediction of the network. In
      contrast, the error of a weight in the output layer just impacts the
      prediction of the network. So as we have to update weights closer to the
      input layer, we have to back-propagate the error over all of the paths the
      weights has had an impact. As you guessed it, this is where the name of
      the back-propagation algorithm comes from. To start simple, we will first
      calculate an update of a weight in the output layer.
    </p>

    <h3>The Output Layer</h3>

    <p>
      We will start by computing one of the simplest updates of the network, the
      update of a weight in the output layer $\hat{y}$. As seen in Figure 7, to
      calculate $\Delta w_{j,0}^{[L]}$ we need to consider the relationship of
      $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $w_{j,0}^{[L]}$. In this case, the function
      $z_0^{[L]}$.

    <p>
      Using the chain rule, we can find the partial derivative of our composite
      function as follows $$ \begin{equation} \frac{\partial
      \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{j,0}^{[L]}} = \frac{\partial
      \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_0^{[L]}} \frac{\partial z_0^{[L]}}{\partial
      w_{j,0}^{[L]}}\, . \end{equation} $$ Let's star by calculating the first
      partial derivative, $$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \frac{\partial
      \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_0^{[L]}} &= \frac{\partial }{\partial
      z_0^{[L]}}\left( \frac{1}{2} \left(y - z_0^{[L]}\right)^2 \right), \\ &= -
      \left(y - z_0^{[L]}\right). \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$ Now the second
      partial derivative, $$ \begin{aligned} \frac{\partial z_0^{[L]}}{\partial
      w_{j,0}^{[L]}} &= a_j^{[L-1]} \cdot w_{j,0}^{[L]} + b_0^{[L]},\\ &=
      a_j^{[L-1]}. \end{aligned} $$ Finally, we can calculate the update $\Delta
      w_{j,0}^{[L]}$ as $$ \Delta w_{j,0}^{[L]} = \alpha \left(y_j -
      z_0^{[L]}\right) \cdot a_j^{[L-1]}, $$ and update our weight
      $w_{j,0}^{[L]} = w_{j,0}^{[L]} - \Delta w_{j,0}^{[L]}.$
    </p>

    <h3>The Last Hidden Layer</h3>

    <p>
      Continuing with a bit more complex derivation, we can proceed to calculate
      an update to a weight $w_{k,j}^{[L-1]}$ in the last hidden layer
      $\bm{h}^{[L-1]}$.
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      Taking as a visual reference Figure 8, to update the weight
      $w_{k,j}^{[L-1]}$, we need to compute $\partial \mathcal{L}/ \partial
      w_{j,k}^{[L-1]}$ using the chain rule $$ \begin{equation} \frac{\partial
      \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{j,k}^{[L-1]}} = \frac{\partial
      \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_0^{[L]}} \frac{\partial z_0^{[L]}}{\partial
      a_j^{[L-1]}} \frac{\partial a_j^{[L-1]}}{\partial z_j^{[L-1]}}
      \frac{\partial z_j^{[L-1]}}{\partial w_{k,j}^{[L-1]}}, \end{equation}$$
      observe that $w_{j,0}^{[L]}$ is a constant in $z_0^{[L]}$.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have already computed the first partial derivative in Equation 3, so we
      proceed to compute the second partial derivative $$ \begin{equation}
      \begin{aligned} \frac{\partial z_0^{[L]}}{\partial a_j^{[L-1]}} &=
      a_j^{[L-1]} \cdot w_{j,0}^{[L]} + b_0^{[L]}, \\ &= w_{j,0}^{[L]} \, .
      \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$ Then, for the third partial derivative,
      recall that $a_j^{[L]}=g\left(z_j^{[L]}\right)$ is the sigmoid function
      and we have already calculated its derivative in Equation 1. So in the
      present set of variables, we have $$ \frac{\partial a_j^{[L-1]}}{\partial
      z_j^{[L-1]}} = a_j^{[L-1]} \cdot \left(1-a_j^{[L-1]}\right). $$ Similarly,
      we have already calculated the final partial derivative for the previous
      layer, so updating the indices we get $$ \frac{\partial
      z_j^{[L-1]}}{\partial w_{k,j}^{[L-1]}} = a_k^{[L-2]}. $$ Putting it all
      together, we can update the weight $w_{k,j}^{[L-1]}$ as $$
      \begin{equation}\Delta w_{k,j}^{[L-1]} = w_{j,0}^{[L]} \cdot a_j^{[L-1]}
      \cdot \left(1-a_j^{[L-1]}\right) \cdot a_k^{[L-2]}. \end{equation}$$ Thus,
      we can update all of the weights in the last hidden layer using Equation
      6.
    </p>

    <h3>A Hidden Layer</h3>

    <p>
      Now we can approach the more complex case of updating a weight
      $w_{k,j}^{[l]}$ in a hidden layer $l$. Having worked through the update of
      the weight of the output layer and the weights of the first hidden layer,
      we can follow a similar approach. Though, we now have to consider that
      $w_{k,j}^{[l]}$ has an impact over more than one path, see Figure 9 below.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img
        src="images/basicsofneuralnetworks/gradient_hidden_layer.png"
        style="width: 650px"
      />
      <figcaption><strong>Figure 9.</strong></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Visually, we see that $w_{k,j}^{[l]}$ impacts all of the neurons it is
      connected to in the next layer, and those neurons impact neurons in the
      next layer and so on. So we need to see how the error produced by
      $w_{k,j}^{[l]}$ has propagated into the next layers. Thus, to calculate
      $\partial \mathcal{L}/ \partial w_{k,j}^{[l]}$ we have to consider all of
      the different paths that lead to the prediction $\hat{y}$. Mathematically,
      this amounts to an application of the chain rule, $$ \begin{equation}
      \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{k,j}^{[l]}} =
      \sum_{m=0}^{|\bm{h}^{l+1}|} \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial
      z_0^{[L]}} \frac{\partial z_j^{[L]}}{\partial a_k^{[L-1]}} \dots
      \frac{\partial z_{m}^{[l+1]} }{\partial a_j^{[l]}} \frac{\partial
      a_j^{[l]}}{\partial z_{j}^{[l]}} \frac{\partial z_j^{[l]}}{\partial
      w_{k,j}^{[l]}}, \end{equation} $$ where $|\bm{h}^{l+1}|$ means the number
      of neurons in the hidden layer, meaning we sum over all of the paths that
      lead to $\hat{y}$ amd thus $\mathcal{L}$. Imagining we have already
      calculated the gradients for the next layer, we can assume we have all of
      the first terms in Equation 7, since they are part of the intermediate
      steps to calculate the gradients. Remember how we used the terms
      calculated for $\Delta w_{j,0}^{[L]}$ in the calculation for $\Delta
      w_{k,j}^{[L-1]}$, see Equation 2 and 4 for reference. We will denote all
      of these terms as $\delta$, $$ \begin{equation} \frac{\partial
      \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{k,j}^{[l]}} = \sum_{m=0}^{|\bm{h}^{l+1}|}
      \delta_{j,m}^{[l+1]} \cdot \frac{\partial z_{m}^{[l+1]} }{\partial
      a_j^{[l]}} \frac{\partial a_j^{[l]}}{\partial z_{j}^{[l]}} \frac{\partial
      z_j^{[l]}}{\partial w_{k,j}^{[l]}}. \end{equation} $$ Continuing with our
      calculation, remember we have already calculated the partial derivative
      $\partial z_m^{[l+1]}/\partial a_j^{[l]}$ in Equation 5. Now we have the
      same derivative but over all neurons in layer $l+1$, so we end up with the
      summation of the weights of the layer $l+1$, $$ \frac{\partial
      z_m^{[l+1]}}{\partial a_j^{[l]}} = \sum_{m=0}^{|\bm{h}^{l+1}|}
      w_{j,m}^{[l+1]}, $$ where $w_{j,m}^{[l+1]}$ are the original weights and
      not the updated values. Finally, we have already calculated the last pair
      of terms previously. So similarly, we get $$ \frac{\partial
      \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{k,j}^{[l]}} = \sum_{m=0}^{|\bm{h}^{l+1}|}
      \delta_{j,m}^{[l+1]} \cdot w_{j,m}^{[l+1]} \cdot a_k^{[l]} \cdot
      (1-a_k^{[l]}) \cdot a_p^{[l-1]}. $$ We have arrived to the propagation of
      the error $\mathcal{L}$ using the intermediate steps of the gradients for
      the next layers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, we can now update the weights of our network. Though, this
      represents a single update of the weights, iteratively using the
      back-propagation algorithm, we can minimize $\mathcal{L}.$
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Hopefully, now you have a clearer understanding of the workings of the
      back-propagation algorithm. So I want to conclude with a final
      observation. The error $\mathcal{L}$ depends on the specific observation
      $\bm{x}$ we made a prediction on. Here, in the development of the
      back-propagation algorithm, we did not give too much attention to the
      input of the network. We used the back-propagation algorithm to update the
      weights of our network with a single observation $\bm{x}$, the true target
      $y$ and the prediction $\hat{y}$. Though, we want a neural network to make
      reliable predictions given new observations. So, in reality, we need a set
      of observations $X$ and the respective targets $Y$ to train a network to
      generalizes well and so the network learns the distribution of the
      training data and not a single observation.
